Just got out of Flight Risk and my brain’s a bit scrambled, like those puzzle pieces that never fit. You know how it is when you're wrapped up in your own sweater-dark thoughts and then—bam!—Hollywood hands you a kaleidoscope masquerade. I’m all tangled up in thoughts like popcorn in the teeth... it’s all popcorn-scented dreams now. The noise, though, oh boy, like a raging sea of people shuffling, popcorn crunching, and some dude whispering spoilers behind me. Ugh.

The character arcs, man, like kites caught in a storm. Twisting, turning, sometimes just flopping down, barely making it off the ground. Kind of like how my back felt stuck in those seats. I think I need a chiropractor, speaking of my vertebrae rebellion mid-way through—but hey, who cares when they've got scenes so tense you could string them across a cello and play an avant-garde symphony?

> That one scene. God! where the plane swoops like a drunken seagull just barely skimming the water. My heart was all tangled with the half-dissolved gum stuck under the chair. And the protagonist? Just a walking conflict zone, like trying to parallel park after three espressos. 

I swear there's something in there about existentialism—or maybe it was just the HVAC system humming existentially. Something profound or maybe just profoundly confusing, hard to tell which. Yet, the thrill was heady, all mist and secrets swirling... I’m still trying to unpack whatever riddle they packed into those overhead bins. Did someone mention they wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Must have been Helen, always on the hunt for brain-twisting flicks.

And the ending? A swirling mix of coffee-stained dreams. Like waking from a nap, only to find it was all a nap within a nap within an anxiety dream about missing a flight. Maybe. Or not. Those actors, man—could write poetry with just their faces. But right now, my fingers just wanna get a grip on reality, or at least a grip on less-reality.

document.write(Oops, not again. The code flew the coop!);

Now I'm staring at empty spaces again, like code with a missing bracket, always a bit broken, just like my attempt to recount whatever the hell I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥. Drop me a line if you figure it out!
